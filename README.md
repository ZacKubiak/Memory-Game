# ArduinoProjects
Projects done in Arduino, for personal and academic purposes.
I am currently learning Arduino, and am doing this for my ILE on the Arch away semester (for RPI).

Project #1: Memory Game (ILE)
  This game is similar to the "Simon" game, where lights and corresponding tones will play in a pattern of increasing length and the player must play them back in the correct       order. 
  This was started 10/18 and minimum viable product was finished 10/19.
