# Memory Game
This game is similar to the "Simon" game, where lights and corresponding tones will play in a pattern of increasing length and the player must play them back in the correct       order. 
This was started 10/18 and minimum viable product was finished 10/19.
I made ths project as part of my ILE plan for my Arch Away semester at RPI.
